In this DiceRollingGame project which can be played 3 players, Playeers enters their names and enter the  round number they wanna play then games start and players who gets more point win games . I tried to apply object oriented programming fundamentels like interface , inheritance , polymorphism encapsulation. 
Also I used to Strategy Design pattern  which is behavioral pattern to provide polymorphism . This pattern is used the when  choosing the different algorithms
